# DevelopmentStack
System development basics, analysis, project/planning, documentation, wireframe/mockup, design/modeling, implementation, quality, management, build, testing, deployment, maintenance, troubleshooting, learning

# What and why?
Have you ever wondered:
* what system development really includes? 
* how many do I possess?


I could not find a really comprehensive diagram that shows the system development stack, so I come up with my own version.

There might be issues here and there, like the category, the individual ones, but the beautity is you can modify it as you want.

You can have a graphical preview here (use mouse to move / zoom):
